- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SlownSteadi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in machine learning and data science. 
- I have mainly participated in projects on environmental monitoring data.
- For example, there are analysis of the impact of intervention on water quality using propensity scoring techniques and 
- analysis of the P/A(presence/absence) characteristics of water quality index species using Shapley additive expansion (SHAP), which is kind of explanable AI (XAI).

- ðŸŒ± Now, after obtaining a master's degree, I am preparing to get a job in the Data Science field.
