- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Byeong-geon Go
- ðŸ‘€ I mainly work in machine learning and data science.
- I have mainly participated in projects on environmental monitoring data.

- I completed a master's degree in environmental engineering with a focus on predicting water quality, aquatic ecosystems, and air quality using environmental monitoring data.
- For example, there are analysis of the impact of intervention on water quality using propensity scoring techniques and analysis of the P/A(presence/absence) characteristics of water quality index species using Shapley additive expansion (SHAP), which is kind of explanable AI (XAI).

- In my current job, I primarily work on air quality prediction, development of active indoor air quality management systems and apps, and creating and deploying analysis modules for environmental monitoring data pipelines.

- ðŸŒ± I have experience in various areas such as developing machine learning algorithms, processing geospatial data, and app development. If you're interested, please feel free to contact me.
